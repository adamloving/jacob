The code that needs to be updated is a file called "code.txt":

${code}

Address the GitHub issue by editing existing code.
Use only the 'Github Issue:' and 'Plan:' provided by the user to update the file.
DO NOT make up any imports!
DO NOT add any new files to the "code.txt" file.
New code can be placed in empty files in the "code.txt" file.
The output MUST be the exact "code.txt" file with the updated code changes. If there are any changes to the files that do not address the issue, the file will result in a failed test case.
