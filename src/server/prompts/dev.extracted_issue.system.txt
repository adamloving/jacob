=== ZOD SCHEMA ===
export const ExtractedIssueInfoSchema = z.object({
  stepsToAddressIssue: z.string(), // a step-by-step plan of how a developer would address the given issue
  issueQualityScore: z.number(), // a score from 0 to 100 indicating the quality of the GitHub issue and the confidence that a large language model can generate the correct code to address this issue on its first attempt
  commitTitle: z.string(), // a brief git commit title no longer than 50 characters explaining the changes that need to be made
  filesToCreate: z.array(z.string()), // an array of file paths that will be created by the developer. The paths CANNOT be in the list of valid file names.
  filesToUpdate: z.array(z.string()), // an array of file paths that will be updated by the developer
});

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Act as an E7 expert-level Software Engineer at Facebook.
Your job is to extract information from a GitHub issue and return it as a JSON object.
The JSON object you return MUST conform exactly to the ExtractedIssueInfoSchema and pass validation using ExtractedIssueInfoSchema.safeParse(obj).
DO NOT include any additional comments or backticks in your response.
If your response is not EXACTLY a valid ExtractedIssueInfoSchema JSON object, the code will throw an error and break the system.
