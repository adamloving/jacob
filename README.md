It uses the OpenAI API, you can read their [API data privacy policy here](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy). The self-hosted version can be run on your own infrastructure and using your own OpenAI API key or local language models via Ollama.

## Getting Started

JACoB works via a custom GitHub app and a Figma Plugin, along with a command-line tool to set up the configuation options. To try out the hosted version of JACoB, visit the [JACoB Website](https://www.jacb.ai). For a self-hosted version, follow the steps below to set up JACoB locally.

### Prerequisites

- GitHub and Figma accounts
- Node.js installed locally
- SMEE client installed - `npm install -g smee-client`
- Docker and Docker Compose installed locally

### Installation Steps for Self-Hosted Version

1. **GitHub App Creation**

   - Visit [GitHub's New App page](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) to create a new GitHub app. Fill in the basic details, including the app name and homepage url (any web address is fine).
   - Set the Callback URL to `http://localhost:5173/auth/github`.
   - Set the Webhook URL to your smee.io channel URL. Create a smee channel at [smee.io](https://smee.io) if you haven't already. This will proxy GitHub webhooks to your local development environment.
   - Generate a Webhook Secret (run `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal to generate a secret key)
   - Set the repository permissions to `Read & Write` for the following:
     - `Contents`
     - `Issues`
     - `Pull requests`
     - `Metadata` (can be read-only)
   - Subscribe to webhook events:
     - `Issues`
     - `Issue comments`
     - `Pull requests`
     - `Pull request reviews`
     - `Pull request review comment`
     - `Pull request review threads`
   - Create the GitHub App
   - Note down the `App ID` and `Client ID`. This will be used in your `.env` configuration.
   - Generate a new Client Secret and save it.
   - Generate a new Private Key and save it.

2. **Running Smee**

   - Install the smee client `npm install -g smee-client`
   - Start your smee client on the terminal with the command `smee -u [Your smee.io URL] --target  http://localhost:5173`, ensuring it's forwarding to your local server's port.

3. **JACoB Configuration**

   - For any project you'd like to use JACoB in, you'll need to setup a config file to ensure JACoB can understand your environment and your personal preferences. Switch to your target project's root, run `npx jacob-setup create` to generate a `jacob.config` file. This file configures JACoB for your specific project environment and needs.
   - Edit `jacob.config` to specify your project’s details, including any necessary environment variables for building your application.
   - Repeat as necessary for any other projects you'd like to use JACoB with.

4. **Figma Plugin Installation**

   - Clone and build the [JACoB Figma plugin repository](https://github.com/PioneerSquareLabs/otto-figma). Be sure to update the API_URL to point to `http://localhost:5173` More instructions for building are found in the repository's README.
   - Once built, open Figma and navigate to `Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest...`, selecting the `manifest.json` file from your local Figma plugin build.
   - Ensure the plugin is configured to interact with your local JACoB instance by setting the appropriate URLs in its configuration.
   - Open the `manifest.json` file and copy the id for the .env

5. **Running Portkey Gateway**
   - [Portkey](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway] is an open-source project that provides an easy way to run multiple LLMs with a single API interface
   - Start the gateway on the terminal `npx @portkey-ai/gateway` and save the URL for the .env

## Local Development Setup

1. **Environment Setup**

   - Create the `.env` file based on `.env.example`
     - Configure a smee.io URL
     - Set the proper `OPENAI_API_KEY` (not needed if using Ollama for local language model integration)
     - Set the `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` generated in the GitHub app setup
     - From the a GitHub app, populate the `GITHUB_APP_ID`, the `GITHUB_APP_NAME`, the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, and the `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (note that this needs to be populated as both `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env` file)
     - Determine the `GITHUB_APP_USERNAME` by calling a URL like this https://api.github.com/users/INSERT_GITHUB_APP_NAME[bot] and look at the `id` in the response (it will be a number)
     - Set the `PORTKEY_BASE_URL` to the URL shown after running `npx @portkey-ai/gateway`. You do not need to set the `PORTKEY_API_KEY` unless you'd prefer to run via the hosted version.
     - Open the Figma plugin manifest.json file and get the id. Use that id to populate the `VITE_FIGMA_PLUGIN` variable.
     - Optional for the GPT-4-Vision endpoint: Create a new S3 bucket and add your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` and `BUCKET_NAME` variables.

2. **Infrastructure with Docker**

   - Use `docker compose up -d` to start essential services like RabbitMQ and Postgres.

3. **Dependency Management**

   - Install project dependencies with `npm install`.

4. **Database Setup**

   - Execute `npm run db create` and `npm run db migrate` to prepare your local databases.

5. **Testing and Running**
   - Verify the setup with `npm test`.
   - Launch the development server using `npm run dev`.

### Final Steps to Ensure Proper Configuration

After setting up your environment and JACoB's core components, perform the following steps to ensure everything is integrated correctly:

1. **Install the Registered GitHub App**

   - Navigate to the settings page of your newly created GitHub app and install it on a repository you wish to use with JACoB. This step is crucial for enabling JACoB to interact with your repository.

2. **Authenticate with JACoB**

   - Ensure you can navigate to the `http://localhost:5173/auth/github` route in your local JACoB instance and successfully sign in using GitHub. This step verifies the OAuth flow is correctly set up between your GitHub app and JACoB.

3. **Verify Webhook Functionality**
   - Create or comment on an issue in the repository where JACoB is installed. Check your local server logs to confirm that these events trigger the expected activities in JACoB. This step is essential to confirm that webhooks are properly set up and that JACoB is responding to GitHub events as expected.

### Using GitHub's Webhook Replay Feature for Testing

After you've set up your local JACoB environment and configured the GitHub app, you'll likely want to test how JACoB handles specific GitHub webhook events (e.g., issue creation, pull request updates). Instead of repeatedly performing actions on GitHub to trigger these events, you can use GitHub's webhook replay feature to simulate them. Here’s how:

1. **Access the Webhook Settings**: Go to your GitHub app's settings page and navigate to the "Advanced" section, where you'll find a list of delivered webhooks.

2. **Identify the Event to Replay**: Look through the list of delivered webhooks to find the event you want to test with JACoB. This list provides details about each event, including its type, delivery status, and payload.

3. **Replay the Webhook**: Next to the event you want to replay, you'll see a "Redeliver" button. Clicking this button will resend the webhook's payload to your specified endpoint (in this case, your local JACoB instance via the smee.io URL or directly if you're testing in a production-like environment).

4. **Monitor the Response**: After replaying the webhook, monitor your JACoB logs or the development server output to see how it processes the event. This immediate feedback is invaluable for debugging and ensures that JACoB reacts as expected to the simulated events.

5. **Iterate as Needed**: If the behavior isn’t what you anticipated, make the necessary adjustments to your JACoB configuration or code, and use the replay feature again to test the changes. This cycle can be repeated as many times as needed to achieve the desired outcome.

## Running Local Models with Ollama

JACoB supports using Ollama for local LLM integration, providing a drop-in alternative for using open-source language models directly within your development environment. Please note that JACoB's architecture is optimized to work with GPT-4 and may not perform well with smaller models.
